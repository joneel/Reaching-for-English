		<h2>How to use the Reaching for English App?</h2> 
		Whether you are a teacher of English or an individual learner, this app provides lessons to improve your reading, writing, speaking, and listening comprehension. Aligned with the English curriculum of Nicaragua but accessible for learners across the world, users choose from a variety of topics to access lesson plans and audio files developed to support English language development. Reaching for English activities are fun, engaging ways to get your students speaking and listening in English. 
		<h2>How can teachers use the App?</h2>
        For classroom use, teachers choose from one of the “Teacher Classroom” topics (1-30), read the directions, and ask students to download the materials on their smart phones from the “Student Classroom” files. Teachers can use the provided lesson plans, with students using their phones to complete the suggested activities. For listening practice outside of class, teachers can choose from one of the “Teacher Independent” topics (1-30), using the provided lesson plan to prepare their students. Students then download the listening material (mp3s) on their smart phones from the “Student Independent” files, listen outside of class, and find the answer to the question asked. If students do not have access to smart phones, teachers can simply recreate the provided materials on a chalkboard or piece of paper.
		<h2>How can students or independent learners use the App?</h2>
		Start by selecting “Student,” then “Independent,” then click on a lesson. Learners can either listen to or read the script as well as record themselves reading the script. Learners have the option to save the recording, open it up for later use, and delete. Only fifteen recordings can be saved at a time.
		<h2>Application Features:</h2>
		• &nbsp;&nbsp;	Teacher or Student: On this screen choose either “Student” or “Teacher.” Teachers have instructional materials, like lesson plans, vocabulary, and suggested assessments. Students have only the lessons.
		<br />
		• &nbsp;&nbsp; Independent or Classroom - On this screen choose either “Independent” (independent learner) or “Classroom” (lessons intended for a group of students).
		<br />
		• &nbsp;&nbsp; Topics - On the “Topic” screen choose a subject to view lessons associated with that topic. Users can go back and pick through different topics without being locked into the first one selected.
		<br />
		• &nbsp;&nbsp; Lessons – on the “Lesson” screen the user will see all the lessons within a given topic. Users select a lesson to view and are taken to the Player and Recorder screen. If the lesson is a PDF file, the app will open a PDF viewer and download the associated file. Users can go back and select any lesson without being locked into the first one selected.
		<br />
		• &nbsp;&nbsp; Player and Recorder: On the Player/Recorder screen users can choose a topic and play the audio recording for listening comprehension. Users can Play, Pause, or Stop the audio at any time as well as change the rate (speed up or slow down) at which it plays. The user can also choose to download that lesson to a smart phone, so it can be used offline. The Recorder gives the option to record oneself reading the script, playing it back, and saving or deleting it on your device. 
		<br />
		• &nbsp;&nbsp; Recording: If the user has a saved recording, the Recording screen offers a list of all saved recordings (with a limit of 15) and allows the user to open one in the Player screen. Users can listen to or delete recordings on the Player screen.
